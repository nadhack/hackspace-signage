# hackspace-signage
This repository contains various files and resources for signage used in and relating to the hackspace.

## Signage creation
Please try to create/edit signage using open source software so that it is accessible by all members without the need to invest in expensive commercial software.

It also helps if signs are created using vector graphics (e.g. SVG, ODG) rather than bitmaps (e.g. BMP, PNG, JPEG) so that quality is maintained when scaled up and file sizes are kept small.

Each signage category directory should include a sub-directory called 'pdfs' containing PDF versions of finished signage documents.

## Recommended Software
Open source software suited to creating signage files:

- 'Draw' from the [Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) suite.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
